        <h2>Learning Coding:how a program is getting more women in tech jobs</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
        I just started a new class that is amazing! It is called tech moms. In this class I am learning to code. So far,
        I have really enjoyed it. The excitement of watching something go from a few words to an entire web page. If you
        are interested, you can look them up on their website.

        The process to apply is very simple. You go to the website and answer a few questions. You choose your location
        and time to start. You will have an opportunity to meet other amazing women. At the end of the program, you will
        be prepared to get a wonderful job in tech and will feel a sense of accomplishment.
