        In my life I was told many times that when one door closes another one opens. Throughout life I felt like I only had one door. That door contained all of the things that women were supposed to do. That door consisted of things like graduate high school, maybe go to college, get married, have kids, be a stay-at-home mom, do the cooking and cleaning, wash laundry, be your kids chauffeur, support your kids in all their activities, and many others. Having a career was not really part of that door. But if a woman worked, she should be a teacher because then a woman was able to work the same time her kids were at school and be off when they were off. When I was growing up, there was nothing wrong with that door. That door seemed like an ambitious goal that I could achieve. That door was my comfort zone. It was my safe place. Now, I am starting to see that there are so many doors of opportunity that I never sought. Those doors were always there, but I was afraid to close my original door to venture into the unknown. I would walk out that door, but then immediately turn around and go back. I felt safer there. For the most part, my life turned out like it should according to that door, but that path did not turn out as smoothly as I expected. I finally got the courage to start closing that door, and because of that I found the door that led to tech-moms. I was always scared of a tech door because I thought coding meant you just use a bunch of 0's and 1's. I was wrong. Welcome to the doors of my tech journey!
